The sea is irregular.
Describe different areas:

The sea is clear. The sun shines gloriously. You can hear seagulls screech as they fly around you.
The waves rise and fall furiously. The sounds of creaking wood are hardly audible under the sounds of the heavy storm.
The current is rising in force. The sky is overcast. The waves become enveloped in foam as they bump up to each other.
